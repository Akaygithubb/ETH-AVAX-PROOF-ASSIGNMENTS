Error Handling Smart Contract
This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for error handling in Ethereum smart contracts.

Smart Contract Overview
The ErrorHandlingContract.sol file contains the Solidity code for the smart contract. It includes a single function setValue(uint256 _newValue) that demonstrates the use of error handling statements.

Functionality
setValue Function:
Validates input using require().
Performs internal state validation using assert().
Reverts the transaction using revert() for specific conditions.
Getting Started
To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Akaygithubb/error-handling-contract.git
Open the project directory and navigate to the ErrorHandlingContract.sol file.

Deploy the contract using Remix IDE or your preferred Ethereum development environment.

Interact with the contract by calling the setValue function with different input values to test error handling scenarios.

Usage
Use Remix IDE or a similar Ethereum development environment to compile and deploy the contract.
Test different input values with the setValue function to observe error handling behavior.
Explore the contract's code to understand how require(), assert(), and revert() statements are used for error handling.
